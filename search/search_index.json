This will launch Poodle locally and create the database <code>test</code>. When first launching a new database, you are greeted with the following message:</p> <pre><code>No question categories specified for database test!\nPlease input list of categories you want to set for this database\nor input 0 if no predetermined categories are desired:\n</code></pre> <p>For now, you can simply input 0 and move on.

Different question types all have their own characteristics with some common features.<sup>1</sup> Initiate the graphical user interface of Poodle by entering the command <code>gtk_overview()</code>. You should see a relatively empty window with some columns and a few buttons on the bottom. Press the New button on the bottom left and press OK in the window that opens. You can now see the template for a new multiple choice question.</p> <p>Name this question question01 and fill in all remaining fields. question is the question's text that is displayed to students, correct_answers and false_answers should be obvious, single (0 or 1) determines if students can check one or more multiple answers as correct, points denotes the max amount of points students can achieve for this question, difficulty is a subjective difficulty ranking from 1 (very easy) to 4 (very hard), time_est is the subjective estimated time for question completion in minutes, family_type can be disregarded for now, just enter single, and in_exams can not be filled at this point. You don't need to worry too much about the exact contents of the question.</p> <p>If you press the Raw tab on the top of the window, you can see what the question looks like at the database level. It might look something like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"name\": \"question01\",\n    \"question\": \"This is our first question.

You can now close the question's window.
